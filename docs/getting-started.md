# InForm

*InForm* is an information managment system with three main functions:

* **Pertinent data at-a-glance**

    Non-sensitive case data is displayed on the homepage to give a quick overview of current residents. 

* **Clear form tracking**

    For each youth, all required forms are displayed and given a status of either To-Do, In Progress, or Complete.

* **Comprehensive Admin functionality**

    An admin page is included that allows basic CRUD operations - creates, reads, updates, and deletes.
