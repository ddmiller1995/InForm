# About InForm

*InForm* is an information managment system with three main functions:

* **Pertinent data at-a-glance**

    Non-sensitive case data is displayed on the homepage to give a quick overview of current residents. 

* **Clear form tracking**

    For each youth, all required forms are displayed and given a status of either To-Do, In Progress, or Complete.

* **Comprehensive Admin functionality**

    An admin page is included that allows basic CRUD operations - creates, reads, updates, and deletes.

This tool was produced in collaboration with Youth Haven. 

## Overview

InForm was built using a combination of Docker, Django, and React. It uses a SQL database. It is intended for use by emergency youth shelters, especially those with a variety of forms and deadlines to juggle. The tool provides a centralized database of client information and deadlines, allowing the staff to prioritize tasks at a glance. The admin panel is designed to be easy to use and accessible for an administrator at a shelter, allowing for most upkeep to be carried out by them. The information displayed on the front page is entirely customizable, letting each program decide what information is most relevant to them.
